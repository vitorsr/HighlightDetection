## About

An ongoing effort of developing new and implementing established single image highlight removal (SIHR) methods on MATLAB.

I welcome and encourage additions upon review.

*Disclaimer 1: this repository is for educational purposes only.*

*Disclaimer 2: these methods are based on chromaticity analysis, they fail miserably for grayscale images.*

## To do

* `Shen2013` is pending code review.

* `Akashi2015` needs code optimization and addition of trials in accordance to their paper. Warning: it'll be **very** slow to debug.

* `Yamamoto2017` → `Yamamoto2019`. In addition, finish adding details in accordance to their improvements. See [Issue #4](https://github.com/vitorsr/SIHR/issues/4).

* `Guo2018` is still **beta**. Pending code review. Add convergence criteria w.r.t. previous iteration.

* Misc. tasks: refactor, format, assertions, etc.

* Major task: rewrite code into an API-like format such that `Y = AuthorYEAR(X);`-type calls are possible.

* Major task: profile code.

* Major task: rewrite into matrix-vector notation (notably `Tan2005` and `Shen2013`).

## Usage

Run `SIHR.m` for path setup.

Run `help SIHR` for (minimal) documentation.
